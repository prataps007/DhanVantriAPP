# Dhanvantri: Medicinal Plant Recognition Android Application

This Android application is developed in **Kotlin** and utilizes machine learning models implemented with the **TensorFlow** library to recognize medicinal plants. The app aims to assist users in identifying various medicinal plants commonly found in our surroundings.

## Features

- **Medicinal Plant Recognition**: Users can capture images of medicinal plants using their device's camera or choose images from the gallery. The application then processes these images using a machine learning model to identify the plant species and provide relevant information.

- **Information Display**: Upon successful identification, the application displays detailed information about the recognized medicinal plant. This information may include the plant's common name, scientific name, medicinal uses, cultivation tips, and more.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface designed to provide a seamless experience for users of all levels.

- **Offline Support**: The machine learning model is integrated into the application, allowing it to work offline without requiring an internet connection for plant recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used for developing the Android application.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework used for implementing the machine learning model responsible for plant recognition.
- **Android Studio**: The official integrated development environment (IDE) for Android application development.
- **Android Camera API**: Utilized for capturing images directly from the device's camera.
- **Android Gallery API**: Used for selecting images from the device's gallery.
- **JSON Data**: Plant information is stored and retrieved using JSON format.
- **Gemini API**: Used for fetching plant-related information.
- **Firebase & Firestore**: Used for backend services and storing user data.
- **Glide**: Used for loading and caching images efficiently.
- *Room**: Used for plants database storage.

## Usage

1. **Capture or Select Image**: Use the camera to capture an image of a medicinal plant or select an image from the device's gallery.
   
2. **Image Processing**: The application processes the captured or selected image using the machine learning model to identify the medicinal plant.
   
3. **View Information**: Once the plant is successfully identified, the application displays detailed information about the plant on the screen.
   
4. **Explore Further**: Users can explore additional information about the medicinal plant, such as its uses, cultivation techniques, and more.
